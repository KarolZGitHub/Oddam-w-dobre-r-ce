The idea behind the project is to create a portal where anyone can donate unwanted items to trusted institutions. To write the application I used the basics of Java, JavaScript, Spring, SpringBoot, Hibernate, JSTL, and provided views. The portal provides an opportunity for users who donate unwanted items to registered institutions to which the items are to go.
In addition, I added the function of admin who can manage the data of the created portal. I created a login panel and the ability to edit the data of the user or institution, and an overview of donated items.
